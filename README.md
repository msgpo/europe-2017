# Toronto Mesh Euro Trip 2017

This started off with various Toronto Meshers expressing interest to attend [34c3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress), then started talks about a longer trip to connect with mesh communities across Europe (like... _irl_), crashing European conferences and running this whole thing as a nomadic hackathon that'll go on for months.

The dates are still a year out, but let's start collecting items of interest and put together a rough itinerary. The trip is not exclusive to Toronto Mesh members, and some people in the mesh community outside of the city have also expressed interest.
